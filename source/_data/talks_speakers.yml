During this talk I am sharing all the PROBLEMS that we came through, how eventually you can come around them and how you can eventually get to an Anti-Micro-frontend Patterns, for example as you try to get rid of the Monolith you end up going back to the Monolith!  I will do a comparison with other solutions like Module Federation and different bundlers such as Vite, RSpack and explain the differences between all these!

        <br />
          Rust on the other hand is a multi-paradigm, general-purpose programming language.
          <br />Rust emphasizes performance, type safety, concurrency, and enforces memory safety. Rust is popular for systems programming but also offers high-level features!

        It's all the rage in Radiator Springs, and becoming the hottest way to build tools that go faster than Lightning McQueen 🏎️. Let's explore the language from the perspective of front-end engineers, see how it compares to TypeScript, and how it might influence the future of front-end.

          More specifically, we'll explore how creating shared standardized platforms helps maintain consistency and reliability across distributed systems, particularly those that have embraced Node.js as their primary runtime. By establishing a shared platform, platform engineers can ensure that all Node.js applications adhere to the same set of standards, simplifying management and maintenance.
          <br />
          We'll begin by covering key principles of Platform engineering, influenced by DevOps, and provide specific examples from my experiences developing shared platforms for Node.js developers."

        talk_description: "Accessibility is becoming a significant topic in the next year, as US and European laws are forcing a lot of industry fields to adjust their websites to become overall accessible.
        <br /> However, product improvements are always first, and features must be released, so let’s add some accessibility in the end, right? <br /> <br />
          Totally no! Let’s go through the process of what it takes to make a website more accessible. We will understand certain pitfalls and typical mistakes developers make when working on accessibility and see how to improve accessibility without starting our whole project from scratch."
